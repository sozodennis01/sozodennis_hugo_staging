## [University of Hawaii at Manoa üßëüèΩ‚Äçüíª](https://ece.hawaii.edu/home/)

### Jan 2024 - Present (Targeting May 2027 Graduation)

#### Computer Engineering | AFROTC DET 175

I‚Äôm Dennis, a Computer Engineering student at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, working toward graduating in May 2027. I‚Äôm also in AFROTC with Detachment 175, preparing to commission into the Space Force. Right now, I‚Äôm part of the [Ke Ao CubeSat project](https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/smallsat/2021/all2021/18/), where we‚Äôre using machine learning to teach a satellite to identify the Hawaiian Islands from space.

When I‚Äôm not studying or hustling, I‚Äôm usually surfing, tending to my bonsai tree, or trying to improve my time management and fitness. I love learning, building things, and finding ways to make a difference in the world!
