## I migrated my old website to Hugo

I decided this new years I would try out the concept **POSSE**, an abbreviation for **Publish (on your) Own Site, [Syndicate](https://indieweb.org/Category:syndication "Category:syndication") Elsewhere**.

Its funny, I tried using Gatsby and NextJS and never really got anywhere. Its crazy how with Chatgpt and LLMs... I'm actually able to knock out some projects/demos in a day.

Anyways the hard part was retooling the Hugo theme and figuring out all the syntax. I'm glad that Hugo can resize images on the fly.

Now I'll start on posting my Refreshes here.
