## About

Hi, I'm Dennis! I'm a Software Quality Assurance Engineer. I test mobile apps that allow people to use SAP from their phones! I'm excited about Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and web3. I do freelance photography, mainly senior portraits. I've been to Germany, France, Spain, Netherlands, South Korea, and the Philippines! I enjoy skateboarding, lifting, and snowboarding (if I had more time). I'm a fan of Linus Tech Tips. My first programming language was Visual Basic!
